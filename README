BraintreeTransparentRedirectSlice
=================================

A slice for the Merb framework that lets you store shit securely in Braintree's
vault (http://dev.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/vault/transparent-redirect/).
You get tokens for user's sensitive info and you can charge against those
tokens.  The information is securely stored in Braintree's vault to allow you
to charge against credit cards without having ANY sensitive information pass
through your controller actions or logs.  It's quite cool.
